That's because our body's production of its natural &quot;energy factories&quot;&mdash;or mitochondria&mdash;goes way down.  Without mitochondria, our cells have no energy... no power to perform their many tasks. <strong>Advanced Cell Rescue</strong> key ingredient is <strong>PQQ </strong>which gives your body what it needs to make new mitochondria... new &quot;energy factories.&quot; </p>  <h2>How will <strong>Advanced Cell Rescue</strong> benefit your health? </h2>  <p>While each ingredient in <strong>Advanced Cell Rescue</strong> provides extraordinary benefits on their own, it's their combined effect that delivers the real longevity power. When you take <strong>Advanced Cell Rescue</strong> daily you'll have&hellip; </p>  <ul>    <li>Sharper thinking, improved memory, and better focus </li>    <li>More pep in your step and a new zest for living </li>    <li>Smoother, healthier, younger looking skin </li>  </ul>  <h2>Why choose <strong>Advanced Cell Rescue</strong>? </h2>  <p>The key ingredient in <strong>Advanced Cell Rescue</strong> is PQQ (short for pyrroloquinoline quinone), which stimulates the creation of mitochondria.  PQQ is a highly potent antioxidant that protects you against oxidative aging. That means your heart, kidneys, brain, and every cell in your body feels younger. </p>  <p><strong>Advanced Cell Rescue</strong> also helps create your mitochondria's natural bodyguard, the super-antioxidant glutathione, so all your new &quot;energy factories&quot; can run at peak efficiency without interference. </p>  <p>Glutathione is perhaps the most important antioxidant in the world. This powerhouse increases nitric oxide, which supports healthy arteries, blood pressure, and healthy muscle function. It also protects your eyes, your blood glucose balance, your brain and all your 100 trillion cells that make your up body.  </p>  <p>However, glutathione is hardly ever used in supplement formulas because of absorption issues. <strong>Advanced Cell Rescue</strong> solves that problem by using the building blocks of glutathione&mdash;N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) and Glycine&mdash;to help your body rev up production naturally. </p>  <p>Finally, <strong>Advanced Cell Rescue</strong> includes astaxanthin help promote younger-looking skin. </p>  <p style=""font-size:9px"">* These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

This helps more CoQ10 get to where it&rsquo;s needed – the vital cells in your heart, brain, eyes, liver, and nearly every important system throughout your body.</p>  <p>In fact, Advanced-Q was found to be six times more absorbable than other standard CoQ10 (unbiquinone) preparations.</p>  <p>Patented VESIsorb® technology turns large CoQ10 molecules into easily absorbed &quot;nanoparticles.&quot; The VESIsorb process works by breaking down the Ubiquinol in Advanced-Q to extremely tiny particles, which are suspended in liquid. These &ldquo;nanoparticles&rdquo; are small enough to pass through your small intestine and into your bloodstream at a much higher rate than most traditional CoQ10 preparations, so you absorb and use more. Plus, Advanced-Q comes in an innovative two-piece Caplique®, which features an airtight band that seals the capsule and shields the CoQ10 inside from oxidative damage.</p>  <p>As we age, we make less CoQ10 and it becomes harder for our bodies to naturally convert the basic ubiquinone form to ubiquinol, which research suggests is so important for combating oxidative stress. Advanced-Q contains CoQ10 in the <strong>Ubiquinol </strong>form, which provides superior support for a healthy heart, brain, nervous system, liver, and blood sugar balance. Plus, Ubiquinol CoQ10 is the best &ldquo;spark plug&rdquo; for helping our bodies make energy at the cellular level – for a difference you can actually feel!</p>  <p>Advanced-Q is the best way to get every bit of benefit from your CoQ10 supplement – for energy you&rsquo;ll feel today, and head-to-toe protection you&rsquo;ll be thankful for tomorrow.</p><p><span style=""font-size:11px"">Suggested Use: Adults take 1 Caplique®* daily, preferably with a meal.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size:11px""> 30 Caplique Capsules </span></p><p><span style=""font-size:11px"">* A Caplique® is a liquid-filled, 2 piece capsule sealed with a band.</span><span style=""font-size:11px""></span></p></div>","Taxable Goods","1.00","","","http://www.nutri-health.com/images/products/11904.png","","http://www.nutri-health.com/images/products/thumbs/11904.jpg","6"

At the same time, they reduce unhealthy irritants that  can worsen sinus conditions and lower your immune response.  </p>  <p>Don’t suffer  another minute of sinus congestion and pounding pressure.

And how crazy is it when you misplace the tool you just had in your hand or spend an hour look for the pair of sunglasses that are sitting on top of your head?<br /><br />Thank goodness for <i><b>Memoril</b></i>!<br /><br /><i><b>Memoril</b></i> is a fast-acting brain-booster clinically proven to improve focus, memory, attention and mood. It includes three super brain nutrients and <i>starts working in less than one hour</i>. Just take a look at the superstar ingredients you&rsquo;ll find in <i><b>Memoril</b></i> and what they can do for you...<br /><br /><b>Enhance Your Ability to Focus, Remember and React</b><br /><b><br />Super Brain Booster #1 &ndash; Cereboost&trade;</b>. Our unique memory formula features a potent American ginseng extract called Cereboost. In a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over clinical study, subjects taking 200 mg daily of Cereboost (the same amount in <i><b>Memoril</b></i>) had great results. In as little as one hour, the participants experienced... <br /><br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improved ability to focus<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More accurate memory recall<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faster reaction time<br /><br />The results of this study establish that Cereboost&trade; has a powerful impact on cognitive performance by enhancing both short and long term memory, attention and focus. These dramatic improvements <i>occurred in less than an hour and lasted up to six hours</i>!<br /><br /><b>Ditch Stress and Anxiety that Affect Your Alertness and Ability to Concentrate</b><br /><br /><b>Super Brain Booster #2 &ndash; Sensoril&reg;</b>. Symptoms of stress and anxiety can have a negative impact on your memory and concentration. That&rsquo;s why we added a highly potent form of ashwagandha extract called Sensoril to our formula. <br /><br />In a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled human clinical trial - the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; in product efficacy validation - researchers found that the ashwagandha in Sensoril <i>significantly reduced forgetfulness and inability to concentrate</i>. <br /><br />It also helps with numerous stress factors that may be interfering with your mental function. Subjects taking 250 mg. of Sensoril were able to sleep better, had a reduction in fatigue and less irritability. Additionally, they experienced fewer incidences of headache and muscle pain. <br /><br />Once you get these symptoms of stress out of the way it&rsquo;s much easier to maintain a relaxed, focused mood that helps naturally promote <i>better concentration, recall, and mental sharpness</i>.<br /><br /><b>A Nourished Brain Works Much Better!</b><br /><br /><b>Super Brain Booster #3 &ndash; Vinpocetine</b>. Increasing blood flow to the brain is essential to keeping your brain healthy and active. That&rsquo;s because your blood delivers all of the oxygen and nutrients necessary for robust brain and nerve cell functioning. But even during normal aging, blood flow to the brain may decrease by 20%.<br /><br />Research shows vinpocetine improves blood flow into the brain. This helps protect brain cells from injury which, in turn, may <i>enhance memory, focus and mental clarity</i>.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t settle for a lifetime of forgetfulness, slow responses and dull-thinking.

But it&rsquo;s probably been a long time since you&rsquo;ve experienced the deep, relaxing sleep that comes when you combine <i>ALL</i> of the powerful natural sleep aids found in <i><b>Sleep Wave</b></i>.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s because each natural ingredient in our proprietary formula works to target the factors that might be keeping you awake at night. Add them all together and we&rsquo;ve covered the bases that may prevent you from getting a sound night&rsquo;s sleep once you&rsquo;ve hit the sack, so you experience <i>every stage</i> of sleep, every night &ndash; including the beta wave sleep that&rsquo;s so critical to your overall health and mental sharpness.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; <b>Can&rsquo;t shut down your mind at bedtime?</b><i> Valerian</i> calms your mind by gently reducing brain activity so you can turn off those mind-racing thoughts and ideas to get a better night&rsquo;s sleep. And it starts working quickly. In one breakthrough study 89 percent of people slept better on the first night and 44 percent reported &ldquo;perfect sleep&rdquo; after just two days.<sup><span style=""font-size: xx-small;""></span></sup><br /><br />2.&nbsp; <b>Don&rsquo;t feel tired enough to fall asleep?</b> Not a problem. <i>Hops</i> has a relaxing effect that helps you get nice and tired for a long night&rsquo;s sleep. It naturally calms your nerves and works together with valerian to get you into a sound sleep more quickly.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; <b>Feeling nervous about the upcoming day?</b> Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ve added <i>lemon balm</i> to soothe agitation and stress, <i>chamomile </i>to calm nerves and <i>passion flower </i>to reduce nervous tension. Together these three compounds can release anxiety and worry to help you experience a deep, relaxing sleep that leaves you feeling renewed and refreshed when you wake up in the morning.<br />&nbsp;<br />4.&nbsp; <b>Too stressed out to even imagine sleeping?</b> That&rsquo;s why we added <i>L-Theanine</i> and <i>GABA</i> to <i><b>Sleep Wave</b></i>. They work hand-in-hand to produce a calming effect that helps reduce stress and balance your brain activity for a better night&rsquo;s sleep.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; <b>Is your sleep schedule all mixed up?</b> <i>Melatonin</i> has the remarkable power to help your body differentiate night from day. If your sleep patterns are out of whack&mdash;if you&rsquo;re burning midnight oil and arriving late to work &ndash; taking melatonin at night can re-establish a regular sleep cycle and help you wake up feeling bright and alert at an earlier hour.<br /><br />6.&nbsp; <b>Does a bad mood or depression have you tossing and turning?</b> <i>Vitamin B6</i> can have a significant impact on the levels of serotonin in your brain. This is the &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; hormone that balances your mood and keeps you feeling happy. B6 is also vital for the production of melatonin. <br /><br />The best news of all is that <i><b>Sleep Wave</b></i> starts working on <i>the very first night</i>. You may fall asleep in as little as 9 minutes and sleep like a baby until morning light. And we guarantee you won&rsquo;t experience any grogginess or brain malfunction when you wake up in the morning. Instead you&rsquo;ll hop out of bed with a fully charged brain and filled with the refreshing energy that follows a good night&rsquo;s sleep. <br /><br /><i><b>Sleep Wave </b></i>is natural and non-habit forming. So you can take it night after night for a deep, relaxing sleep without harmful side effects. <br /><br />Suggested Use: Adults take 2 capsules 30-60 minutes before bedtime.<br /><br />60 Vegetarian Capsules<br /><span style=""color: black;""><br />Not to be taken by pregnant or lactating women. </span></span></span></p>","Taxable Goods","1.00","","","http://www.nutri-health.com/images/products/11406.png","","http://www.nutri-health.com/images/products/thumbs/11406.jpg","8816"
